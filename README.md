Venue Questionnaire developed for Carl Karsten, owner of Next Day Video: http://nextdayvideo.com

This Venue Questionnaire application tracks a host venue's available resources that support recording talks given by groups like the Chicago Python Users Group: http://pyvideo.org/category/14/chipy

This application works on the Web2py (python) framework.  Additional application folders, such as databases, that are listed in the .gitignore file may be required in addition to the code from this repo in order to run the application.  You can easily copy the missing folders from a "hello world" aka "welcome" Web2py application or create them manually.

Contributions to this project are welcomed.  Please direct questions to amberdoctor@gmail.com.

Live questionnaire is hosted at https://chipyvenue.pythonanywhere.com
